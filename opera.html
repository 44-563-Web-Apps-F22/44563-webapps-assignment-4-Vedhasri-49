                     When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                           She wanders to and fro;
                      Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                      And to all questions she replies,
                           With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                      'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                      So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                           An idle breath—
                           Yet life and death
                      May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                      When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                           As owl mopes on a tree;
                      Although she keenly feels the smart,
                      She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                           With its sad "Ah, me!"

                      'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                      Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                           "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
