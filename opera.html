PHOEBE    [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.

WILFRED   Haven't you anything to say to me?

CROWD                    Tower warders,
                           Under orders,
                      Gallant pikemen, valiant sworders!
                           Brave in bearing, Foemen scaring,
                      In their bygone days of daring!

YEOMAN  Poor gentleman! He'll die bravely. I fought under him
        two years since, and he valued his life as it were a
        feather!
    
DAME    Silence, you silly girl; you know not what you say. I
        was born in the old keep, and I've grown grey in it,
        and, please God, I shall die and be buried in it; and
        there's not a stone in its walls that is not as dear
        tome as my right hand.

CHORUS  The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
        O'er London town and all its hoard,
        And men may bleed and men may burn,
        O'er London town and all its hoard,
        O'er London town and its golden hoard
        I keep my silent watch and ward!        

MERYLL  Amen to that! For the Colonel twice saved my life, and
        I'd give the rest of my life to save his! And wilt
        thou not be glad to welcome thy brave brother, with
        the fame of whose exploits all England is a-ringing?
