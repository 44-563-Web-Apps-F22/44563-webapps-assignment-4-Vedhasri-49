<p class="song">
                     When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                           She wanders to and fro;
                      Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                      And to all questions she replies,
                           With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                      'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                      So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                           An idle breath—
                           Yet life and death
                      May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                      When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                           As owl mopes on a tree;
                      Although she keenly feels the smart,
                      She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                           With its sad "Ah, me!"

                      'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                      Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                           "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

     Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go

     These allusions to my professional duties are in
     doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
     I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
     tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
     can't all be sorcerers, you know. 
     Ah! you brought that upon yourself.

<p class="directions">[PHOEBE is annoyed]</p>

<h6 class= "wil">WIL</h6>
<p class="song">
     When jealous torments rack my soul,
                      My agonies I can't control,
                 Oh, better sit on red hot coal
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The red hot coal will hurt no doubt,
                      But red hot coals in time die out,
                 But jealousy you can not rout,
                      Its fires will never fade.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The kerchief on your neck of snow
                      I look on as a deadly foe,
                 It goeth where I dare not go
                      And stops there all day long.

                 The belt that holds you in its grasp
                      Is to my peace of mind a rasp,
                 It claspeth what I can not clasp,
                      Correct me if I'm wrong.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The bird that breakfasts on your lip,
                      I would I had him in my grip,
                 He sippeth where I dare not sip,
                      I can't get over that.

                 The cat you fondle soft and sly,
                      He layeth where I dare not lie.
                 We're not on terms, that cat and I.
                      I do not like that cat.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade.
